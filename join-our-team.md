<p>Dear Current or Future Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, you are probably working at a real estate brokerage and doing between four and 50 transactions per year.</p>

<p>Let me make a few guesses about your current circumstances:</p>

<p>If you’re already an agent, you probably aren’t getting the support that you need in order to advance your career. Many brokerages don’t offer the leads, training, coaching, accountability, or structure required to succeed in this business.</p>

<p>In fact, <strong>87% of real estate agents will fail to achieve the level of success they want and leave the industry within their first five years.</strong> Agents don’t leave the industry because they made too much money. They leave because they didn’t make any. Many agents are not prepared to run a real estate business and have the initial starting capital of just three months’ worth of expenses. </p>

<p>You might long for a kind of lifestyle that your current job can’t afford you—the freedom to maintain your life outside of work as you please, the money to support your family as well as your personal goals, and the time to make all of it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re kept awake at night because you can’t guarantee where your next check will come from, you probably long for the weight of looming bills and the threat of bankruptcy to leave your shoulders. You’re spending money on leads and marketing platforms, but the expenses are piling up. You yearn for guidance about what to do next, and when to do it.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve already sought out a solution to these problems. There are numerous companies out there that promise to deliver quality leads that you can convert into clients, therefore allowing you to grow in your business and personal life. <strong>The trouble is, many of these are merely marketing mirages designed only to recruit you, not to nurture your professional and personal interests.</strong> </p>

<p>You might focus your attention on whether a brokerage offers a high split, but you should know that those don’t provide you with the highest value or the coaching you actually need. Many brokerages spend all day recruiting when they should be spending that time training you to be successful.</p>

<p>With all that in mind, here’s the thing: If you don’t do something different with your career, you’ll probably wind up in that dreaded 87% of the industry—admitting defeat and leaving real estate forever. You’ll go back to a regular 9-to-5 job, forego the comfortable lifestyle you always dreamed of, and re-enter the cycle of making ends meet.</p>

<p>But don’t let your frustrations, anxieties, and past misfortunes get you down. <strong>There is a solution to your problems, and it doesn’t involve letting the real estate business chew you up and spit you out:</strong></p>

<p>I’d like to invite you in for a discussion about becoming a member of our brokerage.</p>

<p><strong>My name is Thurayah McBride and I can help.</strong> Since I’ve started in the real estate business, I’ve closed at least one transaction every month of my career. I began my career in 2016 when I got my real estate license and I hit the ground running. After sharing some of the same lead generation and marketing struggles, I hired a top-producing coach and have seen my business change and grow ever since.</p>

<p>Let me be a little more specific about what my Brokerage has to offer:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Fully-supportive broker management seven days a week</li>
<li>Open house opportunities as available</li>
<li>Branded IDX agent websites with mobile app to assist agents on the go</li>
<li>Productivity standards</li>
<li>20 to 40 leads per month</li>
<li>Powerful CRM with advanced social media targeting, AI capabilities, and much more</li>
<li>Transaction coordinator</li>
<li>E&O insurance</li>
<li>Streamlined paperless transactions</li>
<li>Weekly training and coaching from top industry professionals</li>
<li>Prestigious office suites</li>
<li>Photography, videography, and social media branding department</li>
<li>Marketing coordinator</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>By joining me, I can help you find the success you desire in this business.</strong> I can help you make the money you need to achieve your goals and dreams. I’ll work with you, offer my expertise, and the expertise of other top producers in our market.</p>

<p>If you take me up on my offer to explore whether our brokerage is right for you, I’d be glad to show you that we’re not all just talk—we can prove that what we say actually happens.</p>

<p>Then again, you could also elect to go a different route. But I’ll warn you: Other big-box brokerages often foster a dog-eat-dog atmosphere in which you’re technically a part of the brand, but still left to succeed (or fail) on your own. Many will spend a lot of their time calling or texting you so they can recruit you, but once you’re there, they don’t provide the resources you need to grow your business. Others still will promise you quality leads but, in reality, will provide you with weak Facebook leads from people who aren’t really interested in buying or selling homes and they won’t hold you to the same productivity and educational standards that we will.</p>

<p>The choice is yours: <strong>Face an uncertain industry full of mirages and false promises on your own—or become an agent with our brokerage, consistently netting a strong salary while maintaining a lifestyle fit for you and your family.</strong> </p>

<p>If your interest has been piqued, I do urge you to act quickly. The popular real estate service Redfin is gearing up for a massive advertising campaign across the USA to offer clients a low-commission environment. If you don’t have your business system in place before then, you’ll get crushed.</p>

<p>Let’s get together now so we can make sure you succeed in real estate regardless of what happens next.</p>

<p>I hope to hear from you soon!</p>

<p>Thurayah McBride</p>
