How do you even become a real estate agent?

In the state of Texas, we have the Champion School of Real Estate along with other schools and online courses. I normally recommend going to in-person classes, though given the times, you might need to pursue an online course.

Being able to meet with other real estate agents who have been in the industry for a long time is useful because they can give you some great advice that stems from their own experience.&nbsp;

**After you finish your classes, you’ll send your information to TREC, the Texas Real Estate Commissioner,** where you’ll go in to have your fingerprints taken and do an FBI background check.

Once that’s been taken care of and you’ve paid your application fees, **you can then join a real estate board that operates in your city.** My board is the HAR or the Houston Association of Realtors, but there are also boards in San Antonio and Dallas.

Be sure to have some money saved up before you enter the business. To join the HAR, there is a fee of around $700, and depending on the brokerage you choose and the support you get, there may be other fees like quarterly dues, annual dues, and the monthly fee for your Supra key, which will allow you to access the lockboxes that contain the keys to a home.

Especially when you’re new, **your broker can make or break your success;** you need guidance, training, and someone to support you while you undergo your first few transactions and to help you handle ongoing issues and liabilities that crop up in our line of work. Be sure to interview a few brokerages and narrow your best options down before choosing one.

Many agents think that once they’ve gotten their licenses, they’re done with classes. However that’s not true; since our industry changes so much, you’ll need to make sure that you’re up to date with the latest developments in real estate and the laws that affect the field. That’s why **you’ll need to go back for what are called CE classes (continuing education),** so be sure to block out the times of year where you’ll need to take those courses.

Next time, I’ll discuss another key aspect of starting your real estate career: your brand. In real estate, you need to have a recognizable, memorable brand.

If you have questions about any of these steps on the path to becoming a real estate agent, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to assist you.
