<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m discussing the differences between joining a real estate team or working as a solo agent.</em></p>

When I first got into the real estate business, I had no idea there were massive teams or what the pros and cons were of being part of a team. When I first heard agents were selling between 100 and 500 houses a year, I truly thought they were selling all those homes by themselves\! Of course, they were working on a team with a lot of help. Today I’m going to discuss the differences of joining a team versus working as a solo real estate agent.
