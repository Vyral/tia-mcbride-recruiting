<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Does your team or brokerage have safety procedures in place to keep your agents safe as they go out on appointments?</em></p>

Does your brokerage have safety measures in place to protect your agents as they go out to meet potential clients? It’s a crazy world out there, so you never know what can happen. Here are a few tips that we use to stay safe when meeting with clients we don’t know.

**For those looking at apartments, remember that a majority of apartments in Houston have leasing offices where you can meet people**; most of these offices that I’ve been to will ask for your ID before they allow you to tour the property, which is just one safety measure that can be taken.

Now, if a client calls in about a rental listing, they don’t need a pre-approval like they would with a home. Because we often have to see a few rental properties before the client makes a decision about where they want to lease, they’ll sometimes ask you to come open a particular property for them. **If that’s the case, meet with them at your office or somewhere public like a coffee shop.** There, you can sit down with them, get to know their needs, and also get a copy of their ID so you can be sure they are who they say they are. Then you can take them out for showings—but keep your phone on you while you do, and install a phone tracker if you can.

The majority of home-buying clients will need to get pre-approved to purchase a home, meaning that they’ll have to meet with a lender to have their credit and financial information pulled. But that doesn’t mean that you, as an agent, don’t still need to incorporate some type of safety measure to protect yourself. For example, since our town is so big that it can take a couple of hours to get from one side to the other, **try meeting clients somewhere in the middle and hold the consultation there.**

Additionally, let people know who you’re meeting, and don’t just run out to open doors to properties for people who randomly call you. It’s not professional, and you also don’t have a prior relationship with that person, so you can’t always be sure who you’re meeting with. Besides that, **you need to have a consultation with potential buyers anyway so that you’re not wasting your time** showing houses to strangers without learning more about their needs.

Finally, **send an email to someone at your brokerage, a friend, a spouse, or a family member to let them know where you are.** If you book a showing through a service like Centralized Showings, send someone a copy of the email that details where you’re planning to be and whether you have any extra stops planned.

All markets are different. Here, some of them have open carry laws, so safety is always important to maintain. The goal is to just be safe and always have a plan to let others know where you are just in case something goes awry.
